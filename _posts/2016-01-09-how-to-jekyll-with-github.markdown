This site is built on `Jekyll` and is hosted for free on `Github`. Why? Because I got tired of my Wordpress sites getting hacked, out of date, and otherwise obsolete. What is Jekyll? This is the main post that will direct you how to create, edit and host your Jekyll website on Github for free!

Jekyll is an `opensource`, blog aware, static site generator. Installing Jekyll allows you to locally create a website from text files using `Markdown` or `Textile` or `HTML` and the program compiles a complete static HTML website suitable for your favorite host or FREE on Github. No database to manage. No CMS to constantly update. No data breech or hosting malfunctions. It's perfect for a blog or how-to site, but not so great for anything that requires dynamic content. That would require a database. Jekyll is super fast, super simple, super clean and represents the way forward in web-development.
